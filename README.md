# Information

To whom it may concern,

### PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this repo is to document my current interests and areas of research as well as any personal projects I take on.

### RESUMES: 
I will likely keep one or two different versions of my resume available here at all times if anyone wants to get a view of my value from a slightly different angle!

### PROJECTS: 
I will maintain a list of project ideas in a file called "ProjectIdeas" and I will do my best to keep it updated with my latest thoughts as well as progress updates.

### Lastly, this repo is brand-new and I'd love feedback at how to make it more user friendly. For now I plan to keep it relatively informal.

### Thanks,

### -William
