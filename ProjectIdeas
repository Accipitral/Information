Project Ideas (In no particular order)
    -Simple Virus (self-replicating code)
            -> take this idea and gradually make it more interesting as a way to explore cyber security techniques
     
     -Chess Game
            -Graphical, implement in Java, then Python, then C (if I'm feeling weird)
            -I want to use this to explore multiple topics, I know there are some things in graph theory related to this
            -Basic Machine learning for AI opponent...
      
     -Write a new driver for my keyboard because it isn't great
            -Talk to Prof Janis about this, she made drivers for her job
            
     -Write purposefully bad code such as code vulnerable to buffer overflow and then exploit it
      
     -Develop a personal website -> I've already done a very basic one for a class -> develop it further as a way to explore front end 
        web development -> get it hosted and publicly available.
        
     -Ball room dancing app (Sister's request idea in progress...)
            -IOS and Andriod mobile app dev
            
     -Explore a Rasberry PI -> develop my own linux kernal... (Definitely needs more research)
     
     -Build some form of Economic data analysis and visualization platform
     
     -Indie Game
     
     -Message Encryption and decryption software, cyptography seems very cool.
            -> Have a simple one developed for Systems one, would like to do some research and build one that would actaully take a hot second to be cracked.
            
     -IOT devices, nothing too specific but the possiblities are endless.
            -> I think it would be fun to develop a device that will passively detect which phones/electronic devices are near it and then
                send that data to a back end database... I know these exist so it would be nice to have a comparison point! Also, need to double check this is legal,
                won't test in public until then.
                
      -News Bias Analyzer
            - I think it would be very interesting to develop a tool that scans websites for headlines revolving around the same topic and then somehow
                compares the average connotation of words in each sites articles. For example, FOX News vs CNN on a similar article and measuring the number
                of words with certain connotations maybe give them strength 1-9 1-4 negative (1 most negative) and 6-9 (Postive) with 5 neutral.
             -> Ok after writing that, a better weighting scheme is available but my point stands.
             
       -Resume Parser
             -> Because why not?
